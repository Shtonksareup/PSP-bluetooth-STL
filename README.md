There are a few files here. If you want to make the existing external PSP build. Then you will want the fixed default mount. 

IF you want to make the case build that I designed then you will need the model X base and model X top. 

If you want the dock for your psp to both charge it and put its display to an external monitor you will need an OEM PSP video out cable, and an OEM power cable. (if you want those features) 
The three files are the ones labeled PSwitchP. 
Print them with supports It won't take much but the hinge is printed into the build, and needs the base support for it to print right. I print with a .4mm nozzle, and a 20% infill, but use whatever settings you want if you are printing.
