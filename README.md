There are a few files here. If you want to make the existing external PSP build. Then you will want the fixed default mount. ![default mount](https://github.com/Shtonksareup/PSP-bluetooth-STL/assets/170907656/5e019699-45c1-47d2-a63c-89357aa5c94c)

The NEW BESTEST case is here. I finally finished the shell design that lets you use the UMD drive and bluetooth at the same time. If you want to print that the files have all been added look for PS Placable and make sure you get all of them. Each part is needed, build video should be up tomorrow.

This is the old case build that I designed this is best if you plan to only use the sd card for games or if you only have the motherboard and video out parts. You will need the model X base and model X top. ![psp shell](https://github.com/Shtonksareup/PSP-bluetooth-STL/assets/170907656/e811c84e-9ad5-45bf-a1be-46cd5722404b)

If you want the dock for your psp to both charge it and put its display to an external monitor you will need an OEM PSP video out cable, and an OEM power cable. (if you want those features) 
The three files are the ones labeled SwitchStation Portable. (credit to Euro234 on reddit for the name) 
Print them with supports It won't take much but the hinge is printed into the build, and needs the base support for it to print right. I print with a .4mm nozzle, and a 20% infill, but use whatever settings you want if you are printing. 
The holes have been adjusted for m3 screws I wouldnt use much longer the 6mm mine are 5mm
