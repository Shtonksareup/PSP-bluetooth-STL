Hello everyone!! This page is being updated to match the V2 of the BT mod. The new files will be added friday 8/1/2025 that will work with the BT mod on Stephens git hub. Sadly for now the BT boards are sold out on my site. The only way to get them is to order them yourself. There are guides for that which I will link here as well. [website](https://www.retromodworks.com/all-guides/buying-guide/from-the-factory). You will want the orginal model of the STL files that have buttons on the base of the system.

There are a few files here. If you want to make the existing external PSP build. Then you will want the "Play Station Placeable ESP32 on Ste2425 hardware page". ![New motherboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed684d9-35b7-4ba8-885c-6c641876b9ae)



The NEW BESTEST case is here. I finally finished the shell design that lets you use the UMD drive and bluetooth at the same time. If you want to print that the files have all been added in the Play Station Placeable folder and make sure you get all of them. Each part is needed.
